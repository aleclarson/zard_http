# Contributing

## Getting Started

1.  Ensure you have the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) installed (version 3.0.0 or later).
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    dart pub get
    ```

## Development Workflow

### Formatting

Always format your code before committing:

```bash
dart format .
```

### Static Analysis

Ensure your changes pass static analysis:

```bash
dart analyze
```

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This helps us automate versioning and changelog generation.

Example: `feat: add support for custom parsers`

For more details on automated agent workflows, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Publishing

This project is prepared for publication on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

We recommend using [version_assist](https://pub.dev/packages/version_assist) to automate versioning and keep your `README.md` version badges in sync.

When preparing a new release:

1.  Update the `version` in `pubspec.yaml` (e.g., using `version_assist`).
2.  Document the changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3.  Run `dart pub publish --dry-run` to verify the package and check for potential issues.
4.  Run `dart pub publish` to release.

## Submitting Changes

1.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
2.  Implement your changes.
3.  Ensure code is formatted and passes analysis.
4.  Submit a Pull Request.
